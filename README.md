# practice

A random collection of unusable code I'm sure

Hmm...

*Installed Node.js 

*Installed request module

*Added some rudimentary code but it's a start!


*Node.js is turning my brain to mush, while I can get the information I need from it in the shell, I can't figure out how to
output it to the browser just yet.

*Did some quick and probably really ugly coding for api calls in javascript. Need to make it prettier. Next goals
are formatting!
